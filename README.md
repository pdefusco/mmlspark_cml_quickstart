https://github.com/Azure/mmlspark/blob/master/notebooks/samples/TextAnalytics%20-%20Amazon%20Book%20Reviews.ipynb

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

##### NB: Do not install the library with the pip command. This is not required and will conflict with the below approach.

1. Create an empty CML Project (not from the git repo)

- In CML, launch a Session with Workbench editor 
- Launch the Terminal Editor
- Clone the repository with "git clone https://github.com/pdefusco/mmlspark_cml_quickstart.git"
- The project files will be saved into the mmlspark_cml_quickstart directory

2. Run the mmlspark_cml_quickstart.py file in a CML Session

- Using the same or a new CML Session, run the entire script
- Notice the mmlspark library is being loaded from Maven via SparkSession
